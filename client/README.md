This is the Blobbackup Mac and Windows application.

All GUI code is written using [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/), platform specific binaries are made using [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the backup engine under the hood is [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic).
