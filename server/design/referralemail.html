        <b>Don't Risk Losing Your Files</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that time you almost spilled coffee on your keyboard? Or that time you left your 
        laptop in your car? Liquid damage and computer theft are just two of the many ways you could 
        lose your files. Here are the <b>Top 9 Causes of Data Loss:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Accidental Deletion: People accidentally deleting or overwriting important files is the most common form of data loss. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Virus & Ransomware: Downloading the wrong file or using insecure Wifi can infect your computer with viruses or ransomware. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Hard Drive Crash: Both classic hard drives and modern solid state drives can and do fail through no fault of the user. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Power Outages: Sudden power outages can corrupt your files as well as various computer hardware components. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Computer Theft: If you travel with your laptop or work in public spaces often (eg: cafes), you're vulnerable to computer theft. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Liquid Damage: Spilling coffee or water on your computer can cause a short circuit, making data loss very likely. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Sudden Disasters: From tornadoes to fire, disasters can happen unexpectedly. And when they do, data loss is inevitable. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Corrupt Software: Improper software shutdowns and failures at the wrong time can cause serious issues for your data. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Hackers & Insiders: Bad actors on the internet or even inside your home/business can cause harm to your important files. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>Why do I need a cloud backup?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not a question of will you lose your data—it's when. Whether it's a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, or the more common virus, hard drive crash, laptop left in a Uber, or coffee spill, your computer will eventually lose your photos, music, and documents. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>I bought external storage (HD, SSD, NAS). Am I safe?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a good start. But do you back up your data every day (Blobbackup backs up every hour)? Or do you sometimes forget? Are you sure you're backing up the right files? Are your computer and external storage in the same place, making both susceptible to the same risks? What if you go on a trip and leave the external storage at home? You can't back up or restore files while you're gone. And if you take it with you? Then you're more likely to lose both your laptop and external storage at the same time! 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>I use a sync service like Dropbox. Am I safe?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Services like Dropbox and Google Drive synchronize folders between devices. While it's better than nothing, it's not a computer backup. Only data inside a few folders are in the cloud (not the entire computer), ransomware and accidental deletions are still issues, there's no end-to-end encryption, and you'll pay roughly 2-3 times as much for the amount of storage Blobbackup offers. Sync services are designed for collaboration while backup services are designed for disaster recovery. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How am I backed up with Blobbackup?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You download a tiny application that installs in a few clicks and doesn't require a credit card or any information to start using. The application automatically finds all your photos, music, documents, and other irreplaceable files—no matter where they are on your hard drive. Then in the background, the application makes an encrypted copy of the files on our secure cloud. Thanks to efficient algorithms, we can do this every hour in the background without hogging computer resources. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Can't I recover data from a dead hard drive?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes, but it will be very expensive. Data recovery companies will charge up to $3,000 to attempt to recover your data with no guarantee that you'll glean anything from it. For the price of one attempted $3,000 recovery, we can back up your computer for 28 years at $9 per month. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Can your employees see my files?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        No. All your files are encrypted before it leaves your computer with your password. Your password is never stored (or even sent) to our servers and we use state of the art encryption algorithms. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Can I pay yearly? What are the payment options?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We only offer monthly billing at this time. We will bill you $9 per computer every month after your trial ends. We accept payment via credit card, debit card and PayPal. We don't accept orders, checks, ACH/wire or cryptocurrency. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Are taxes included in the price?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        No. Any taxes we collect are in addition to the per computer price. Whether or not we collect tax and how much depends on your jurisdiction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Will I be charged when my trial is up?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        No. We don't ask for your credit card up front, so you'll only be charged when you decide you’re ready. If you want to continue after your trial, we'll ask for payment details. If not — cancel with a click, no questions asked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What if I have more questions?</b>
    </p>

        We'd be happy to <a href="https://blobbackup.com/support">answer them</a>.
