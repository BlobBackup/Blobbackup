Enter your password when prompted and hit Okay. You'll then see 
a dialog pop up. In the new dialog, select the snapshot (point in time)
that you'd like to restore from and the files that you want to 
restore from that snapshot. Click Restore To once you've selected
some files and specify a destination folder.

After selecting a destination folder, you'll be asked to confirm 
your selection. Hit confirm and your files will be restored!
