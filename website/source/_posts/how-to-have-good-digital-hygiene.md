We are all taught to practice good physical hygiene. We have a habit of taking showers, brushing teeth and washing clothing. And we know that not practicing good physical hygiene has immediate consequences on our self-confidence, health and personal relationships. If I go for a week without showering, I'll feel gross. If I don't wash my clothes routinely, other people will start to notice. It goes without saying that physical hygiene is very important.

We don't have the same attitude towards digital hygiene. In many ways, it's understandable. While everyone knows (more or less) what I mean when I say physical hygiene, it's not immediately clear what I mean by digital hygiene. Does it mean keeping my electronic devices sanitized at all times? Does it mean having a clean email inbox? Or perhaps a clean desktop? There isn't a widely understood definition. 

I define digital hygiene as the collection of habits that make me feel good about my digital life. This includes things like keeping my operating system and other software up to date, using strong passwords whenever possible and routinely backing up my files and folders. Much like physical hygiene, I know that if I didn't practice these habits, there would be consequences. If I don't keep my operating system up to date, I'm missing out on exciting new features and improvements. If I don't use strong passwords, I'm vulnerable to hackers. While the consequences are not as immediate as with physical hygiene, they are certainly there.

To some extent, the question of good hygiene (physical or digital) is a personal and subjective one. Some people will find brushing their teeth twice a day good enough while others brush their teeth after every meal. Some people are are perfectly happy using the same handful of passwords on all their sites while others use a unique random password on every website. In both worlds, there are many perfectly reasonable positions to take. Exactly what your position is will depend on your sensitivity to various risks (like cavities and getting hacked). 

That being said, not every position on the hygiene spectrum is equally good. There are some physical hygiene behaviors that can universally be recommended. You should brush your teeth at least twice a day. You should shower at least once a day. You should wash your dirty clothes. While you may be willing to risk cavities more than the average person or develop body odor very slowly, these recommendations are still worth taking. They are habits that will help avoid health and wellness consequences that everyone wants to avoid.

What are these universal recommendations for digital hygiene then? What is the equivalent of showering daily in the digital world? This is a non-trivial question to answer. People's digital sensibilities are more varied than their physical ones. It's reasonable to assume that most people want to avoid disease and losing friends. So the physical hygiene recommendations of showering daily and washing your clothes make sense. But it's harder to make the same assumptions about people's sensitivity to privacy, security and staying up to date on their software. 

Below, I've outlined the handful of digital hygiene practices that I think everyone should follow. I've tried to be mindful of practicality, technical overhead, privacy and security but again, there is a wide spectrum here. Where you fall on the spectrum depends on you and you only.

With that disclaimer aside, here is how you should be practicing good digital hygiene.

# Use a Password Manager

Most of us have tens to hundreds of online accounts. And each one of them has a password. If you're like the average person, you use the same (or slightly modified) password on each account. While this is easy and simple, if even one of those accounts were to be compromised, you'd be in for a world of trouble. If your account on some sketchy website with substandard security practices were hacked, your email or your online banking account might be too. Needless to say, using the same (or similar) password everywhere is not secure at all.

Ideally, you'd use a unique randomly generated password for every website. This way, even if your account on the sketchy website is compromised, your life won't get turned upside down. This is where password managers come in. Tracking all these unique passwords yourself in a notebook or text file would be time consuming, inconvenient and insecure. 

Password managers like 1Password and Bitwarden let you use and securely store strong unique passwords for every account. Here is how it works. The password manager will generate a unique password for you when you register for an account on a website. This password will then be encrypted using something called your "master" password. Now the next time you want to log in to that account, you simply provide your "master" password again and the password manager will use that to decrypt the unique password it originally generated. If that sounds complicated to you, don't worry. Using password managers is actually intuitive and easy once you get the hang of it.
