The process for updating Blobbackup is the same on Windows and Mac.

**Step 1**: Download the latest version (requires logging in).

**Step 2**: Make sure Blobbackup is not currently running on your computer (Click Quit from the menu or system tray to stop it if it is running).

**Step 3**: Install the newly downloaded version from **Step 1**.

That's it! Your app should be updated.
