If you have a NAS or external drives connected to your Mac and you DON'T want them backed up, this page shows you how to exclude them.

Open the Settings window:

Under the exclusions tab, click add:

Type the exclusion "/Volumes" and click Ok.

Save you exclusions.

You'll have to restart your backup (if it's currently taking place) for the changes to take effect. To do this, click the Stop Backup button.

That same button will turn into the Backup Now button. Click that to restart you backup.
