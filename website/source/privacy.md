# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information is collected and how it is used and protected by BlobBackup LLC., its websites (including www.blobbackup.com), products and services (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”.) BlobBackup defines Personal Information as your name, email address or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information. By using the Services, you expressly consent to the use of data as described in this Privacy Policy.

# How BlobBackup Uses Information

BlobBackup is committed to providing a high-performance, secure, easy-to-use online backup service. Data collected is used exclusively with the goal of providing, marketing and improving this service.

BlobBackup encrypts all your computer data locally with your password before sending it to BlobBackup's storage servers over an encrypted channel. BlobBackup does not store your encryption password anywhere on our servers.

No Spam. BlobBackup will not sell, rent, trade or give away your email address or other contact information to any other organization.

No Spyware/Adware/Malware. BlobBackup software is designed to backup your files online and contains no spyware or other unwanted applications.

No Third Party Advertising. BlobBackup does not intend to advertise for other organizations through its website or email communications.

We aim to provide you an excellent experience with our service. For additional detail on how we handle your data or to contact us with questions, please see the rest of the Privacy Policy below.

# Information Collection

By using the online backup service, the system automatically encrypts and transfers your files to BlobBackup servers. Certain information will be available to BlobBackup such as type of operating system, computer hostname, or MAC address to enable BlobBackup to provide the service or help support you. BlobBackup cannot look at your actual files because they are encrypted with your password.

You may provide information such as your name, email address, or other requested information to purchase or use the service. You may also provide us information when you email or call us, or through feedback and other forms on the website.

# Sharing and Disclosures

BlobBackup uses trusted third parties for services such as billing and customer service software, and certain data is shared with these parties to help provide the Service.

If BlobBackup is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

# Security

BlobBackup is committed to the security of your data and has put in place industry standard physical and electronic enforcement mechanisms. BlobBackup products automatically encrypt your data before transmission and send the encrypted data using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Your data is stored in a secure location with access controls for authorized employees only.

# Privacy Policy Changes

BlobBackup may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We expect these changes to be minor. New policies will be posted to www.blobbackup.com/privacy and, for material changes, we will announce more prominently (including potential email notification.) Your continued usage of the Service expressly constitutes consent.
