# Recurring Billing

BlobBackup will automatically re-bill your credit card each month.

# No Refunds

The free trial is designed to let you experience the service. If you sign up for a subscription, you are welcome to cancel at any time, but we cannot issue any refunds.

# Charge Disputes

If you have any dispute regarding charges to your account, you have 45 days from the date of the charge to dispute it. Please contact our support team regarding any questions concerning a charge.

# Canceling Service

To cancel your subscription, simply sign-in to your Account and delete your payment method.

# Unpaid Accounts

If BlobBackup is unable to re-bill your account during a renewal, computers on your account will stop backing up. Continued non-payment will result in your backed up data being deleted.
