                <p class="mt-4">
                    We are all taught to practice good physical hygiene. We have a habit of taking showers, brushing teeth and washing clothing. And we know that not practicing good physical hygiene has immediate consequences on our self-confidence, health and personal relationships. If I go for a week without showering, I'll feel gross. If I don't wash my clothes routinely, other people will start to notice. It goes without saying that physical hygiene is very important.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    We don't have the same attitude towards digital hygiene. In many ways, it's understandable. While everyone knows (more or less) what I mean when I say physical hygiene, it's not immediately clear what I mean by digital hygiene. Does it mean keeping my electronic devices sanitized at all times? Does it mean having a clean email inbox? Or perhaps a clean desktop? There isn't a widely understood definition. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    I define digital hygiene as the collection of habits that make me feel good about my digital life. This includes things like keeping my operating system and other software up to date, using strong passwords whenever possible and routinely backing up my files and folders. Much like physical hygiene, I know that if I didn't practice these habits, there would be consequences. If I don't keep my operating system up to date, I'm missing out on exciting new features and improvements. If I don't use strong passwords, I'm vulnerable to hackers. While the consequences are not as immediate as with physical hygiene, they are certainly there.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    To some extent, the question of good hygiene (physical or digital) is a personal and subjective one. Some people will find brushing their teeth twice a day good enough while others brush their teeth after every meal. Some people are are perfectly happy using the same handful of passwords on all their sites while others use a unique random password on every website. In both worlds, there are many perfectly reasonable positions to take. Exactly what your position is will depend on your sensitivity to various risks (like cavities and getting hacked). 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    That being said, not every position on the hygiene spectrum is equally good. There are some physical hygiene behaviors that can universally be recommended. You should brush your teeth at least twice a day. You should shower at least once a day. You should wash your dirty clothes. While you may be willing to risk cavities more than the average person or develop body odor very slowly, these recommendations are still worth taking. They are habits that will help avoid health and wellness consequences that everyone wants to avoid.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    What are these universal recommendations for digital hygiene then? What is the equivalent of showering daily in the digital world? This is a non-trivial question to answer. People's digital sensibilities are more varied than their physical ones. It's reasonable to assume that most people want to avoid disease and losing friends. So the physical hygiene recommendations of showering daily and washing your clothes make sense. But it's harder to make the same assumptions about people's sensitivity to privacy, security and staying up to date on their software.
